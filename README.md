### Using the project with vscode devcontainer
**Linux**

0. Install docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ (, and make sure docker daemon is running)
2. Install [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with [devcontainer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers), and [remote dev pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker).
3. Clone this project's code. Rename `/.devcontainer/devcontainer.linux.json` to `/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
4. Open this project in vscode. Vscode should automatically detect the devcontainer and prompt you to `Reopen in container`. If not, see [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container). Note: Opening the container for the first time might take a while (up to 10mins), as the container is pulled from the web and build.

**Windows** (requires Windows 10 or later)

For windows, we require WSL2 to run the devcontainer. Full instructions can be found [in the official docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2020/07/01/containers-wsl#_getting-started). Here are the important steps:
1. Install docker: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/, and WSL2, and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (, and make sure docker daemon is running)
2. Docker will recognize that you have WSL installed and prompt you via Windows Notifications to enable WSL integration -> confirm with `Enable WSL integration`. If not, open `Docker Desktop`, navigate to the settings, and manuallyâ€¯enable WSL integration. (There are TWO setting options for this. Make sure to enable both!)
3. Install [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with the [WSL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl), [devcontainer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers), and [remote dev pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker).
4. Clone the source code for the exercises in the WSL2 file system to `/home` (`~`), or wherever you like. (Performance when working on the WSL file system is much better compared to Windows filesystem). You can access the WSL filesystem either by starting a WSL/Ubuntu console, or via the Windows File Explorer at `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home` (replace `Ubuntu` with your distro, if necessary).
7. Rename `/.devcontainer/devcontainer.windows.json` to `/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
8. Open this project in vscode. The easiest way to do so is to start an WSL/Ubuntu shell, navigate via `cd` to the source code, then type `code .` to open VSCode. Vscode should automatically detect the devcontainer and prompt you to `Reopen in container`. If not, [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container). Note: Opening the container for the first time might take a while (up to 10mins), as the container is pulled from the web and build.


**Mac**

Should work like Ubuntu. Untested.

Known Issues:
   - if building docker container fails at `RUN apt-get update`, make sure your host systems time is set correct: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1511514/docker-build-fails-at-run-apt-update-error-failed-to-solve-process-bin-sh

## Known Issues
- `"RuntimeError: MUJOCO_PATH environment variable is not set"` upon installing this package. This error can be resolved by using `venv` instead of `conda`. Somtimes the `mujoco` install can [fail with `conda`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/issues/1004).
- If using `zsh` don't forget to escape brackets when installing additional dependencies: `pip install .\[gpu\]`.
